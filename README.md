## Quick start

Just run

```bash
npm install zeroconf-redux
npx zeroconf-redux
# Yay!
```

Your browser will open and you can start coding your awesome [React]/[Redux] web app now!

If it does not exists, a basic *index.js* file will be created to be used
as the entry for your [budo] dev server.

Read below for more details and instructions about how to create a package
and launch your dev server with an `npm start`.

## Usage

If you have no *package.json* yet, create one now! For instance with
`npm init` or even (for the lazy ones like me :^)

```bash
npm init -y
```

**Tip**: If it is not a package you want to add to the npm registry, you
should add the following attribute to your *package.json* file.

```json
  "private": true,
```


Then with [npm] do

```bash
npm install zeroconf-redux --save-dev
```

The following dependencies will be installed:

* [babel-core]
* [babel-preset-env]
* [babel-preset-es2015]
* [babel-preset-react]
* [babelify]
* [budo]
* [envify]
* [react][React]
* [react-dom]
* [react-redux]
* [redux][Redux]
* [UglifyJS]
* [uglifyify]

On `postinstall` a *.babelrc* is created, if it does not exists.
It has the following content

```json
{ "presets": [ "env", "es2015", "react" ] }
```

If you want to trigger it manually, you can run

```bash
npm explore zeroconf-redux npm run copy_babelrc
```

Assuming there is an *index.html* in the same folder as the *package.json*
with a content like the following...

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

... add an npm script to your *package.json*, to run [budo] dev server,
something like

```json
    "start": "budo index.js --dir . --serve bundle.js --open -- -t babelify",
```

Your *index.js* looks something like

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    You can start coding <em>index.js</em> file.
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Now, running `npm start` it will

1. Build your code using *index.js* as entry.
2. Open your *index.html* in your browser.
3. Start watching HTML, JS and CSS files, with livereload on changes.

In the [examples/counter folder][counter_example] there is a copy of the [classic Redux counter example][redux_counter].
You can run it with this command

```bash
npm explore zeroconf-redux npm run example_counter
```

## Production build

Following instructions from [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#browserify), suppose
your package main attribute points to your entry file, for instance *src/index.js*,
and your bundle file is *dist/NAME.min.js*, where *NAME* is
your package name, you could add an npm script like the following

```json
    "browserify": "browserify ${npm_package_name} -t babelify -g [ envify --NODE_ENV production ] -g uglifyify | uglifyjs --compress --mangle > dist/${npm_package_name}.min.js",
```

## Customization

### Babel preset env

> By targeting specific browsers, Babel can do less work so you can ship native ES2015+ ðŸ˜Ž!

For example, you may edit your *.babelrc* to target specific chrome version

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", { "targets": { "chrome": "60" } }],
    "react"
  ]
}
```

For more details see [babel-preset-env].

### Async Redux

Probably you need to call an asynchronous API: the standard way is to use
the [Redux Thunk middleware][redux-thunk], so you need to install

```bash
npm install redux-thunk --save
```

This choice is up to you. For example you could prefer [redux-saga].
Since there are few alternatives this package does not include a middleware to dispatch async actions. See [Async Actions chapter on official Redux documentation][AsyncActions] for details.
